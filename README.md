# A launchpad where the tokens are distributed with a constant tokenstream using superfluid

The project is pretty much the same as https://github.com/henmeh/Moralis_Avalanche_Launchpad. The main difference is in the distribution of the project tokens to the wallet of the investor. When the investor is buying some project tokens a certain percentage will be locked inside an nft not in the actual launchpad contract. This nft is send to the wallet of the investor. In Truffle\contracts\MagePadNFT.sol you can see the smart contract for the nft. You will recognize that when minting the nft there is also a constant token stream created for the tokens that are locked inside the nft. So by using the superfluid protocol the tokens will be unlocked and send to the wallet of the investor with a constand stream. The investor doesn't need to do anything. He/she can also trade the nft. While the nft is on the market for sale the stream is stopped. When the nft changes owner after a buy event the stream will go on but now to the address of the new owner. So basically this is a marketplace for tokenstreams.
